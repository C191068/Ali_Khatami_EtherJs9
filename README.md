###  Optional Prettier Formatting

We can also prettier as node.js module that can tell other users who don't have VS code <br>
how to format their both javascript and solidity <br>

We have a created a new file .prettierrc <br>

here we can define what we want for both our solidiy and javavscript <br>

For example in our akrkSimpleStorage.sol there is a tab width of ```4``` <br>

Now we set the tab width = 2;

thus we can see here only 2 spaces <br>

now to remove the semi colon i have use the above line of code <br>
